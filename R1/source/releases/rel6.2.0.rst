Varnish Cache 6.2.0 is a significant update from Varnish Cache 6.1, both under the hood and in new functionality.

If upgrading from 6.0 or 6.1, most users will not encounter any problems. However, VMODs and and VUT programs have to be recompiled, and for some users the VCL needs to be updated slightly.
